# Complex

Arduino library for Complex mathematical operations.


## Description

This library defines the complex data type and all the common mathematical functions for it.

These functions include basic = "+ - \* /" and also power and goniometric functions.

The library implements the **Printable** interface so one can directly print the complex values
in any stream e.g. Serial.


## Interface

See Complex.h for a full list of functions implemented.

The library uses **float** for the real and imaginary part so precision is limited.
Reasons are memory and performance, see also Future section below.

The library implements the constant **one** as this value is often used in the code.


## Note

The library has a big footprint so it fills up the memory of an UNO quite fast,
especially if all functionality is used.


#### Known problem

Issue found in version 0.1.9 - https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/issues/90
Class does not compile for DUE and TEENSY
Also Raspberry Pico - https://github.com/RobTillaart/Complex/issues/6

Apparently the name "Complex" is already in use (reserved) by some non-AVR compilers 
so it won't include the Complex.h file. Problem seen on Due and Teensy3.5



#### Solution

- Make a copy of the Complex Library and rename the folder to CComplex
- Rename Complex.h to CComplex.h
- Rename Complex.cpp to CComplex.cpp
- change one line in CComplex.cpp to include CComplex.h
- note your sketches need to include CComplex.h too.


## Future

- create a (8 byte) double based variant for high precision e.g. Complex8()  
Note that some platforms map double to float, others support float in hardware etc  
so there is a big difference expected in both memory and performance
- create the constant **i** ??
